Thanks for deciding to contribute to this project! (for whatever reason)

# Intro
This project uses react. You need to know react and js. After cloning `npm i` and then `npm run start` to start.

# Code standards
If your code works and doesn't break it entirely it's fine. Preferably add types via JSDoc where applicable. Improvement to the existing code are highly welcome.

# Opening PR
It's preferable that you detail what you've done in the PR so I can include it in the update notes and credit properly. If you plan any huge changes please open an issue first.
